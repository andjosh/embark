Embark
========

My personal nodejs framework app. Handles local auth, user accounts, data storage, sockets, API, transactional email, cleaning the dishes, etc.

## Is it any good?
Save _me_ a ton of time. Probably will for you as well.

## Setup
- `npm install`
- `node app.js`
- Make a new heroku app
- Add on postmark and some mongoDB and newrelic
- `git push heroku master`
